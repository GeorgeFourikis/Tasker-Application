<h1>Talon Tasker</h1>
<p>This is my implementation of a simple ToDo app but on steroids.The very prinsiples and the concept of this application can be found on the origins and roots of Web Development.</p>

<h2>So what makes it different?</h2>
<p>It's an application that started getting structured using Node js and Express js with MongoDB.And it was meant to stay that way but after i got pushed from my teacher to try and 
add React and Axios on the main functionality,i made it.</p>

<h2>Whats the difference between Versions then?</h2>
<p>The difference between Versions is pretty simple. <br> Version 1 is meant to have the main functionality along with a nice use of Materialize CSS framework. <br>
Version 2 has to do with core libraries-packages that need to be used,such as Google Maps API, Calendar API and Passport API.</p>
